# linkedinwithdraw
This repository contains a JavaScript script designed to automate the process of withdrawing LinkedIn invitations. The script clicks on withdraw buttons for invitations older than a specified threshold, helping users manage their sent invitations efficiently. It automatically stops after 100 withdraws or a full page, so start from the last.
